            <h3>About the Project</h3>

            <p>
              The Police in Politics project is a partnership between
              <a href="https://mijente.net/">Mijente</a>
              ,
              <a href="http://www.bu.edu/spark/">BU Spark!</a>
              , and the
              <a href="https://www.aclum.org/">ACLU of Massachusetts</a>
               to investigate police
                       donations to Massachusetts politicians. It is supported by some great
                       technical volunteers, including Steve Backman.
            </p>

            <p>Please note that BU Spark! participates in this project as a
                           technical partner, providing data processing and visualizations
                          only, and that neither the lab nor the university necessarily
                          endorses the political analysis of these data as interpreted
                          by Mijente and ACLU-MA.</p>
