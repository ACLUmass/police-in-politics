    <h3>About the Project</h3>

    <p>
      The Police in Politics project is a partnership between
      <a href="https://mijente.net/">Mijente</a>
      ,
      <a href="http://www.bu.edu/spark/">BU Spark!</a>
      , and the
      <a href="https://www.aclum.org/">ACLU of Massachusetts</a>
      to investigate police
      donations to Massachusetts politicians. It is supported by some great
      technical volunteers, including Steve Backman.
    </p>

    <p>Please note that BU Spark! participates in this project as a
     technical partner, providing data processing and visualizations
     only, and that neither the lab nor the university necessarily
     endorses the political analysis of these data as interpreted
   by Mijente and ACLU-MA.</p>

   <p>This project is ongoing. Check back later for further analysis of police donations to elected officials across Massachusetts.</p>

   <h3>About the Data</h3>
   All data displayed here are compiled from publicly
   available information supplied by the
   <a href="https://www.ocpf.us/">Massachusetts Office of Campaign and Political Finance (OCPF).</a>
